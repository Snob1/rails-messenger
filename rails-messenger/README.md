Hey Kaito!
How's it going? This is a "draft proposal" about how to make messenger app, though this is coded in rails.
The thing you first do is I guess, update ruby and install rails, if you want to run this app. Also, if you don't have a github account, you can download this app in this or linked page, so you don't need to spend some time making github account. I think it's going to be a bit difficult for you to understand concept by scanning this code. Don't hesitate to ask me if you have any doubts. Have a nice weekend!
